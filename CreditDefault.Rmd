## 
```{r}
test <- read.csv(file="./data/test_bqCt9Pv.csv", header=TRUE,as.is=T)
head(test)
train <- read.csv(file="./data/train.csv")
head(train)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
